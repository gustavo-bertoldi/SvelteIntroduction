# Svelte Introduction

>This is a quick introduction to [Svelte](https://svelte.dev/) including a comparison of a simple web application written in Svelte and in vanilla JavaScript. 

To open the **Svelte** project, go to the `Svelte` folder and run the following commands in a terminal. Note you need to have NodeJS installed in order to run the Svelte project.

```bash
npm install #Only if it is the first time you are running the project
npm run dev
```

To run the vanilla JavaScript version, simply open the `index.html` file using a web browser.


## Creating a new Svelte app
```bash
npm init vite my-app -- --template svelte
cd my-app
npm install
npm run dev
```
